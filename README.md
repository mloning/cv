# Curriculum vitae

Code to construct my _curriculum vitae_ (CV) in LaTex.

If you'd like to read my CV because you're interested in me or my work, this is probably not the right repository for you. Instead, please check out [my website](https://elizabeth-dupre.com), where you can find the rendered version of this CV and more information on my ongoing projects.

---

If, instead, you're interested in the _code to generate_ my CV, then you're in the right place.

## Standing on the shoulders of giants
The code is based on [Elizabeth Dupre](https://github.com/emdupre/dupre-cv)'s code. The overall style was inspired by [Olivia Guest](http://oliviaguest.com)'s CV,
who was in turn inspired by the [JTEppinette resume template](https://www.overleaf.com/articles/jteppinette-resume/wcsdpbkfmstz).

## Compilation
To generate the pdf, simply run `make build`.
